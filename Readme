This repository contains a deep learning model trained to detect animals in foggy conditions to prevent vehicle-wildlife collisions.

- [**animal_detection_model.keras**]: Pre-trained model file that contains the architecture and weights.
- [**model_training_and_inference.ipynb**]: Jupyter notebook with the full code, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Use the Model:

### 1. **Download the Model**:
You can download the model file from [animal_detection_model.keras](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/blob/main/animal_detection_model.keras).

### 2. **Install Dependencies**:
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the model from the downloaded file
model = load_model('path_to_downloaded_model/animal_detection_model.keras')

# Print the model's architecture
model.summary()

In this way you can see the model and architecture of model.
